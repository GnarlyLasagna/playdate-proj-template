### C Example Template 
**Hello World** : A barebones C demo and a useful starting point for development

This folder contains projects demonstrating usage of the C interface to the Playdate runtime. The code is not extensively commented but hopefully gives an idea how some of the interfaces work. See "Inside Playdate with C" for more information on how to build these projects using Xcode, Visual Studio, Make and CMake.
